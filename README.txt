Adfluence (static demo) — v4
================================

New in v4:
- FIXED alignment: How/Why are centered and stacked cleanly.
- REMOVED pricing section.
- Animated stepper section.
- Gallery with lightbox.
- Contact/lead form (Netlify Forms ready).

Contact form options:
1) **Netlify Forms (recommended)** — Deploy to Netlify and ensure the form tag has `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Netlify will capture submissions automatically in your site dashboard.
2) **Formspree (works anywhere)** — Replace the `<form ...>` tag with:
   <form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-id" method="POST">
   (Create a free Formspree project to get your endpoint.)

Images added:
- assets/hero.png — hero image linked on the landing page
- assets/partners.png — partner logo strip
- assets/badges.png — trust badges
- assets/avatars.png — avatar set
- assets/pattern.png — decorative band
- assets/logo.svg / assets/favicon.svg — brand mark
